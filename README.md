# Javascript-Drum-Machine
 *By Angelo Deleon*


 ### About Project:
 #### This is a small project creating a "Drumpad" beatbox machine with HTML/CSS/Javascript. Pretty simple project nothing fancy..NOT YET ANYWAYS :)

 ### Future Plans:
 * Add a option to record 30-60sec session of using drums and playback or save/share to social media
 * Option to load different soundbanks for different drum kits or sounds. I dont want to be overly ambitious but maybe a small beat making machine with alot of sounds besides drums.
 * Be able to share your beat to social media.


**If you want to contribute to project and add some cool features be my guest I will approve commits to project**

Thank you!
